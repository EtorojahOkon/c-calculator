# c-calculator
A C# winforms calculator application
My first c# application with powerful capabilities

Functionality includes:

a. Arithmetic operations

b. Trigonometric functions

c. Logarithmic functions

d. Quadratic functions

Additionally, this calculator logs all actions performed on console for easy reference
I actually coded the ui without visual studio...
